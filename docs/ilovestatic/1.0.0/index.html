        <article><h1>ILOVESTATIC - Work in progress</h1><p>SEO-optimized, 100% Google Lighthouse Score static website generator.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2><p>Most websites don't need much, just some beautiful styling, text, images and maybe a contact form. But most developers reach for bulky frameworks and libraries like Angular, React, Ember, jQuery, or even something with a database an more complexity like WordPress, Drupal, etc. by default, because it's cool, fun to work with and everyone else is doing it.</p>
<p>The only problem with this, is these simple websites only need a tiny fraction of the code that's being used, which can cause slower page-loading times, poor SEO performance (since JavaScript may not be rendered by all engines as expected) and a much more complexity than it needs to have.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More code = more slow.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>This solution</h2><p>ILOVESTATIC is as simple as it gets: it takes in Markdown via a built-in CMS (no coding necessary), optimizes it for SEO and fast-loading performance, runs it through a mustache.js template and creates squeaky-clean HTML files for you to serve from anywhere, and usually for free.</p>
<p>All of our themes score 100% on the Google Lighthouse tool, which means that they folow all of Google's best practices and standards for websites to load content and interactivity fast, work offline, have non render-blocking JavaScript, optimized images, etc. You get all that for free, without any stress or effort.</p>
<p>ILOVESTATIC is also extremely flexible in its simplicity, and can be tweaked and styled any way that you like.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2><p>This package uses NPM and Node.js.</p>
<p>Recommended:</p>
<p>As of NPM version 5.2.0, you can run this CLI tool without installing it. Simply run this line in the terminal of your project directory:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-sh"><code>npx ilovestatic new</code></pre><p>Download as global dependency:</p>
<p>You can also download the CLI as a standard global dependency like you normally would:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-sh"><code>npm i -g ilovestatic</code></pre><p>Or you can use the Yarn package manager</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-sh"><code>yarn global add ilovestatic</code></pre><h2>Usage</h2><p>Simply run the new command and you'll see a prompt that will ask you a few questions to get you all set up</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-sh"><code>npx ilovestatic new</code></pre></article>
