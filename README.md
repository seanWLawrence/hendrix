# Hendrix - Work in progress [not ready for use]

An extensible CLI scaffolding tool for creating scripts, pages and configuration file boilerplates.

## The problem

Writing boilerplate sucks. It's time-consuming, redundant and should be automated.

## This solution

Hendrix allows you to use or create boilerplates easily and create them using its CLI tool. Answer a few questions about your file and you're ready to start coding. 

## Installation and usage

This package uses NPM and Node.js.

Recommended:

As of NPM version 5.2.0, you can run this CLI tool without installing it. Simply run this line in the terminal of your project directory:

```sh
npx hendrix
```

Download as global dependency:

You can also download the CLI as a standard global dependency like you normally would:

```sh
npm i -g hendrix
```

Or you can use the Yarn package manager

```sh
yarn global add hendrix
```

And then launch it with the following command:
```sh
hendrix
```
